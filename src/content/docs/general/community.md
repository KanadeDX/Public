description: Join the KanadeDX community and get help from other players.

There is a Discord server and a Telegram group chat for KanadeDX. Release files will be published on these platforms.

However, from February 27, 2025, they are set to invite-only to control the rapid growth of the community and to avoid unwanted attention.

If you want to join, please find someone who is already in the group and ask for an invite link.

Public invite links will be available again in the future when the community is more manageable.
