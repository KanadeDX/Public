## ✨ KanadeDX is now based on SDGA 1.55! ✨
- &quot;KanadeDX: 浮光掠影&quot; is now based on SDGA 1.55
- All PRISM PLUS visual effects and general features
- Tracks marked as &quot;LONG&quot; can now be played properly
- Touch Holds outside of the C section can now be judged correctly

* Due to the same code limitations as SDGA 1.55, the KALEID x SCOPE mode is currently only able to play the first 6 gates.
* The new version is compatible with resources from the previous version. However, for the best experience, you can redownload and re-import updated external resources such as StreamingAssets and Options.
* Users who use Loading Cache will need to regenerate it.
* Official download channels for the new version&#x27;s resources have not yet been released. Please continue to follow the KanadeDX channel for future updates.
* You can also find and import compatible resources yourself. Resource conversion may be required.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where you couldn&#x27;t properly enter AdvDemoProcess (the &quot;RECOMMENDED MUSIC!&quot; Demo).

## Known Issues
- Potential decrease in gameplay performance.
* Since PRISM PLUS adds more visual effects, its rendering occupies more system resources. KanadeDX has optimized performance as much as possible, but due to the nature of the game&#x27;s implementation, it&#x27;s still not possible to guarantee performance close to previous versions. We recommend that users with weaker device performance temporarily stay on the old version (KanadeDX: 現実逃避) for their gameplay experience.

## Unknown Issues
- Due to the extensive underlying changes in this update, it&#x27;s inevitable that some features may be incomplete during the testing phase. If you believe you have encountered an unknown issue, please report it in the KanadeDX Telegram group &quot;Help/求助&quot; sub-channel. Your contribution is greatly appreciated.
