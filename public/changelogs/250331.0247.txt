*Optimizations*

* ⚡️ Resource Caching ⚡️
You can now generate a cache in launcher settings. This will greatly improve loading speed the next time you start the game.

Important: If you make any changes to resources after caching—such as editing xml, chart files, or adding/modifying/deleting Option files—please regenerate the cache.

* Freedom Mode material has been updated from Japanese to English thank to community contribution.
* &quot;Don&#x27;t break the cab&quot; warning has been added back and will display during loading.
